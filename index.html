            <p>Lady Jane's changed my life, when I first walked in the shop I was a frail insecure man and when I walked out I was no longer a virgin.  I'm not exaggerating when I say that if I hadn't gone to Lady Jane's Haircuts for Men that fateful tuesday afternoon that I would've defintely killed myself later on that night...I mean I had already purchased the noose and everything.  I can now go through life with my head held high because I know that whenver things aren't going well I can count on Lady Jane to fully service me from head to crotch.  Whenever my friends ask me why I seem so my happier these days I just reply &quot;Lady Jane's&quot; and they say &quot;What's that?&quot; and I say &quot;It's like a sports bar for your head&quot; and then they say &quot;Dats sick.&quot;  So yeah anyways, what was the question?</p>
